# Austin Weather Analysis
This project analyzes and visualizes the Austin weather data. Special thanks to Durgance Gaur, Tomasz Sikora, and Kim Tae Heon for this amazing dataset that contains Austin daily weather data which was obtained from WeatherUnderground.com, at the Austin KATT station. You can find this dataset at kaggle.com/datasets/grubenm/austin-weather/data

## Goal
Built a machine learning model to predict rainfall based on historical weather variables and analyzing seasonal patterns of temperature and precipitation in Austin, Texas.

## Key Objectives
- Create modelling about predicted vs actual precipitation happened in Austin
- Seasonal Analysis Pattern by create modelling of average temperature and average precipitation by month
- Visualization data by using Matplotlib

## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit Learn

## Insights
- The model produces good predictive performance with a high RÂ² value.
- There is a correlation between average temperature and monthly rainfall.
- The summer months show peak temperatures and minimal rainfall.
